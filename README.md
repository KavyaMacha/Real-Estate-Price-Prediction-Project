Real Estate Price Prediction Project

This project aims to develop a model that predicts real estate prices based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and market trends. Using a dataset containing historical real estate transactions and property attributes, the model is trained to learn the relationships between these features and property prices. Various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks can be employed for prediction. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to create an accurate price prediction system. It serves as a valuable tool for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions.
